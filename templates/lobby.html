    <p>
        PDFInsieme is a collaborative presentation tool.<br>
        It was originally designed to solve a common problem in video calls:<br>
        when sharing a PDF presentation, only one person controls the slides, and everyone else has to say "please click next".
    </p>

    <p>
        With PDFInsieme, participants can stay in sync automatically.<br>
        The presenter advances the slides, and all viewers (including guests) see the same page in real time.<br>
        Additional features include a presenter view, shared laser pointer, upload handling, and guest access links.
